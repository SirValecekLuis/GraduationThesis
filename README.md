GraduationThesis
This work is used for school purposes(graduation work) and is typed in OOP way. You can use it for your needs, if you find anything useful from this code.

Goal of my work: Create an app that will show in PyQt5 information about CPU and GPU and in second tab an option to make a graph with selected information and see how your components and their temperatures, speed of fan or memory(and a few more) are increasing or decreasing.

I'm using pythonnet with Open Hardware Monitor, these are key things for my project as I didnt find any other way how to access temperatures and other information with python. Many packages are old, not updated or moved to linux only(linux is more accessable for information from PC, which Windows certainly isn't). Important thing to know you need to have C++ tools (cca. 15GB) to work with pythonnet and .dll files, otherwise your IDE/idle will show errors.

I will be using some NumPy arrays to make my large arrays faster for matplotlib processing later in PyQt5.

In PyQt5, I will be using Canvas and toolbar to see and move in my graphs(from matplotlib).

Basic libraries like math or time and csv are used for some simple operations and steps to achieve something.

The whole code is in english except DOCs and comments, sorry for that. I need to have it in czech. Feel free to contact me.

Kind regards, Tobias aka SirValecekLuis
